# SEGMENTATION-OF-CREDIT-CARD-HOLDERS-BASED-ON-USAGE-BEHAVIOUR
In marketing, market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers into sub-groups of customers. Here the objective is to categorize credit card holders into different segments based on some shared characteristics so that later for new credit card holders, recommendations can be given for saving plans, loans, wealth management, etc.

# LIFE CYCLE OF THE PROJECT

**DATA CLEANING-->IN 2 COLUMNS,MINIMUM PAYMENTS AND CREDIT LIMIT,MISSING VALUES WERE FILLED UP WITH THE MEAN VALUE OF THE OTHER PRESENT RECORDS**

**2.FEATURE SCALING-->WE SCALE DOWN THE DATA UNIFORMLY AS CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS ARE BASED ON DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POINTS**

**3.PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS-->WE PERFORM PCA ON THE DAT SO THAT WE CAN THE VISUALIZE THE CLUSTER BETTER IN LOWER DIMENSION**

**4.MODELLING-WE TRY TO CLUSTER THE DATA USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND HIERARCHIAL CLUSTERING.BASED ON THE RESULTS WE GET,WE CHOOSE K-MEANS CLUSTERING MODEL AS OUR FINAL CLUSTERING MODEL**

**5.VALIDATION-TO PERFORM VALIDATION OF THE CLUSTERING MODEL WE HAD CHOOSEN EARLIER,WE TAKE THE NEW CLUSTERED DATASET AND TRY TO FIT DECISION TREE AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS ON IT.BASED ON THE RESULTS,WE CHOOSE LOGISTIC REGRESSION AS OUR FINAL VALIDATION MODEL**
